[2025-10-27 10:15:12] INIT  :: Snapshot baseline of original repository and Manus fork.
[2025-10-27 10:22:44] ANALYZE:: Compared directory trees; identified delta in docs, agents, backend, data/supabase, screenshots.
[2025-10-27 11:05:33] SYNC   :: Copied unique Manus specification assets into working tree (`docs/spec`, `speckit_v2.pdf`).
[2025-10-27 12:41:02] MERGE  :: Reconciled `README.md` (root) with DMaaS endpoint documentation and CI setup guidance.
[2025-10-27 13:04:58] MERGE  :: Updated `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` template with new import paths, manual testing steps, and migration stats.
[2025-10-27 14:17:26] MERGE  :: Consolidated `agents/README.md` to emphasize secret rotation, `.venv-agents`, and CrewAI smoke job context.
[2025-10-27 15:09:47] MERGE  :: Refreshed `data/supabase/README.md` with quick-start checklist and deployment cross-links.
[2025-10-28 09:32:11] AUDIT  :: Reviewed Supabase migration provenance schema alignment (Manus vs legacy) and staged updates.
[2025-10-28 11:48:03] EDIT   :: Added `front_photo_url`, `side_photo_url`, and `normalized_measurements` table with RLS policies into `002_measurement_provenance.sql`.
[2025-10-28 13:22:55] VERIFY :: Confirmed `git status` shows expected touchpoints; screenshots noted as auxiliary assets pending commit decision.
[2025-10-28 18:44:10] DOCS   :: Logged merge steps in `CHANGELOG.md` (Version 2.1) covering documentation, database, and asset updates.
[2025-10-29 08:01:39] REVIEW :: Final sanity check on README/PR template alignment with FastAPI DMaaS endpoints and API key workflow.
[2025-11-03 09:48:17] AUDIT  :: Investigated pytest collection failures; traced duplicate Manus merge blocks in backend routers and agent tools.
[2025-11-03 10:21:05] FIX    :: Reconciled measurement schemas, error envelopes, and measurement routers; restored agent tool logic to single-source implementation.
[2025-11-03 10:54:33] TEST   :: Ran `scripts/test_all.sh`; backend (11) and agent (9) suites now passing after cleanup.
[2025-11-03 11:10:02] COMMIT :: Recorded `chore(repo): reconcile merge cleanup` and pushed to `origin/main`; left `screenshots/` untracked pending asset policy.
[2025-11-03 15:47:31] DOCS   :: Captured CrewAI merge summary in `PR_DESCRIPTION.md`; committed (`docs: capture CrewAI merge summary in PR_Description.md`) and pushed `merge-crew-ai` to origin.
[2025-11-05 13:34:22] OPS    :: Killed lingering uvicorn processes (PIDs 67323/67326, 84436/84439) and relaunched backend with `nohup uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` after `scripts/dev_server.sh` hit sandbox bind restrictions; startup still logs the Supabase `proxy` kwarg warning and `/dmaas/latest` 404s.
[2025-11-05 13:41:55] OPS    :: Recreated `.venv-agents` under Python 3.11 (initial Python 3.14 env failed on `tiktoken` Rust build) and installed `crewai/openai/python-dotenv`; `scripts/run_agents_env.sh` now imports properly when `PYTHONPATH` is set but aborts with OpenAI 401s because `.env` still contains the placeholder `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
