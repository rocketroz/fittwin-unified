# Services Directory

This folder gathers non-Node services that complement the TypeScript/Nest stack.
Current structure:

- `python/measurement` – houses the FastAPI measurement service imported from the CrewAI/Manus work. Keep its virtualenv assets isolated from the Node workspace.

Add additional service families (e.g., Go workers) under their own language-specific subfolders.
