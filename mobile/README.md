# Native Mobile Integrations

Native mobile code imported from the unified repo lives here. The existing
NativeScript labs remain under `frontend/nativescript`.

- `ios/FitTwinApp/` – SwiftUI + LiDAR capture app targeting iOS. Keep this
  project in sync while deciding which flows to surface in NativeScript vs
  maintaining a native shell.

Treat these projects as reference implementations until we define the long-term
mobile strategy.
