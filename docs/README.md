# Documentation Hub

The FitTwin monorepo now collects planning, operations, and specification
artifacts from the CrewAI/Manus and unified platform efforts. Key folders:

- `overview/` – platform-wide summaries, architecture notes, production
  readiness snapshots, and Codex session transcripts.
- `ops/` – environment setup, Supabase runbooks, integration checklists, and
  other operational guides.
- `measurement/` – geometry notes and technical background for the measurement
  microservice.
- `mobile/` – iOS capture status and LiDAR implementation guides.
- `prompts/` – system prompt archives used during CrewAI workflows.
- `../specs/` – structured feature specifications that predate this merge.

As new material is imported, prefer placing general-purpose guides under
`docs/` and leave `specs/` for slice-level product documents.
