# Competitor Technology Research - Body Measurement Apps

## Key Findings

### 3DLook (Market Leader)
**Technology Stack:**
- ✅ **2 photos only** (front + side)
- ✅ **AI-based computer vision** (no LiDAR required)
- ✅ **Patented statistical generative human body model** (Patent #US10706262)
- ✅ **Works on ANY smartphone** (Android + iOS)
- ✅ **No special hardware required**
- ✅ **Real-time pose detection and guidance**
- ✅ **Clothing recognition for accuracy**

**Process:**
1. Body segmentation from 2 photos
2. 3D model processing with advanced statistical generation
3. Computer vision + deep learning analysis
4. Neural networks determine landmarks
5. Produces probability maps

**Accuracy:** Professional-grade without LiDAR

### MTailor
**Technology Stack:**
- ✅ **Video capture** (30 seconds)
- ✅ **Machine learning algorithms**
- ✅ **Front pose + side pose** image processing
- ✅ **No LiDAR required**
- ✅ **Works on standard phone cameras**

**Process:**
1. User records brief video
2. Algorithm extracts frames
3. ML processes front + side poses
4. Generates full set of measurements

### Industry Standard: Photo-Based AI (NOT LiDAR)

**Why competitors DON'T use LiDAR:**
1. LiDAR only on rear camera (user can't see themselves)
2. Limited to iPhone 12 Pro+ (small user base)
3. AI-based photo analysis is MORE practical
4. Accuracy is comparable when done correctly
5. Works on ALL phones (bigger market)

## Recommendation for FitTwin

**Build Option B: AI-Based Photo Measurement**

**Why:**
- ✅ Front-facing camera (user can see screen)
- ✅ Works on all iPhones (iPhone 8+)
- ✅ Industry-proven technology
- ✅ Professional accuracy without LiDAR
- ✅ I can fully develop and test this
- ✅ Matches what market leaders use

**Technology Approach:**
1. **Computer Vision**: Body segmentation, pose detection
2. **Deep Learning**: Statistical body model generation
3. **AR Overlay**: Real-time guidance for positioning
4. **2 Photos**: Front view + side view
5. **AI Processing**: Extract 50+ measurements

**Accuracy Target:** ±2cm (matches 3DLook's claims)
